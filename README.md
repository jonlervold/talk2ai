### Other

This app falls under the category of Open-Source / Bring-Your-Own-Key applications, which the Usage Guidelines section of the documentation states can be made live without an app review so long as users' API keys are not stored on the server and that the application does not fall into any domains deemed unacceptable. This application is entirely client-side code and does not have the capability to store API keys. Communication runs directly from the user's browser to OpenAI.
